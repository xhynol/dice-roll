  Classwork
  
  Some of the code didn't work and it was hard to find the bug. If I made a mistake it would affect my whole entire code. I noticed I used the table a lot and it helpped me a lot. Most of the code was already practiced skills. The enhancement I did was to make the pictures clickable-->
